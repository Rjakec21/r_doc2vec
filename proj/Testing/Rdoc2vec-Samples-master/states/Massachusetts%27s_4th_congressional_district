Kennedy III   ( D – Brookline ) Cook PVI D+9 [1] Massachusetts's 4th congressional district  is located mostly in southern  Massachusetts . It is represented by Democrat  Joseph P. Kennedy III . The district covers much of the area included in the  10th district  before the 1982  redistricting . In prior years, the district stretched from Brookline to Fitchburg. The shape of the district underwent some changes effective from the elections of 2012, after Massachusetts congressional redistricting to reflect the 2010 census. [2]  Most of Plymouth County and the  South Coast  are included in the new 9th district. The new 4th district has expanded westward to include towns along the Rhode Island border that had been in the old 3rd district. For a very brief time (1793–95) it represented part of the  District of Maine .
