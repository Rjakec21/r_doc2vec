As a result of population changes reflected in the 1970 U.S. Census and a concern to ensure that the  2nd Congressional District  was majority African American, the district was redrawn to include the Northshore. This was done to comply with the  Voting Rights Act , passed in 1965 to enforce constitutional rights of minorities in voting, including the opportunity to elect a representative of their choosing and to redistrict after censuses. In 1974, the state legislature redefined the 1st Congressional District, dropping its precincts south of the lake and adding  St. Tammany Parish , which borders Lake Pontchartrain on the north, from the  6th Congressional District . Subsequently, the 1st Congressional District acquired  Tangipahoa  and  Washington  parishes, both north of the lake, from the 6th Congressional District. Correspondingly, the 1st Congressional District shed conservative  St. Bernard Parish  and other areas south of the lake to the  3rd Congressional District  from 1984 through 2013. Overall, the 1st Congressional District has become a very safe district for the  Republican Party . [2]
