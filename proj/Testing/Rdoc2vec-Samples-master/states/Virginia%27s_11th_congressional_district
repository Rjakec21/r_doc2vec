The district stretches from  Herndon  to  Quantico , comprising most of  Fairfax County , all of the  city of Fairfax , and part of eastern  Prince William County . The residents of the 11th district are represented by Democrat  Gerry Connolly . The Hill  newspaper quotes census data to conclude that Virginia's 11th district was the wealthiest congressional district in the nation from 2003 to 2013. The article attributed the wealth to the many lobbyists and two-career couples in  Northern Virginia . [2] The district last existed in what is now West Virginia's  1st District  and was held by  Jacob B. Blair  before the events of the  U.S. Civil War . Virginia did not have an 11th District until it was re-created after the  1990 United States Census  from portions of the old 8th and 10th districts because of explosive growth in Northern Virginia. It was intended to be a "fair fight" district; indeed, it encompassed most of the more  Democratic  portions of the old  10th District  and the more Republican portions of the old  8th District .  George W. Bush  only narrowly defeated  John Kerry  here in 2004, while Democratic Governor  Tim Kaine  and Democratic Senator  Jim Webb  both carried this district, in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In 2008,  Barack Obama  won this district over Republican Senator  John McCain . Democrat  Leslie L. Byrne  briefly held the seat for the first election cycle of the new district, but was quickly defeated in 1994 by Republican  Tom Davis . Davis established a secure hold on the district during his tenure (1995–2008), but Democrat Gerald Connolly won it when Davis stepped down. Both Davis and Connolly may have been aided by their previous service on the Board of Supervisors of  Fairfax County , where most of the 11th district's population is concentrated. 61.5% of 11th Congressional District residents live in Fairfax County.
