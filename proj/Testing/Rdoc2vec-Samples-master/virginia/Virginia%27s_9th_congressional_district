The 9th is Virginia's second-largest district in  area , covering 8800.24 square miles (slightly larger than the whole state of  New Jersey ). The current representative is  Morgan Griffith  ( R ). Despite the fact that the district had been in Democratic hands for nearly three decades, it has always had a strong social conservative bent, one that turned it towards the Republicans starting in the 1990s. It last supported a Democrat for president in  1996 , and has only supported a Democrat in two statewide contests since then. Republican presidential candidate  John McCain  received 59% of the vote in the 9th district in  2008 , his best performance in any of Virginia's eleven congressional districts. The 9th District is the only district in Virginia that cast more votes for  Hillary Clinton  than  Barack Obama  in the  2008 Democratic Presidential Primary . Clinton won more than 60% of the vote here despite Congressman  Rick Boucher 's endorsement of Obama.
