NOTE: This district's boundaries were changed in 2016. This map is not presently accurate.
Florida's 5th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Florida. It extends along Florida's northern boundary from Jacksonville to Tallahassee.
From 2013 until 2017, the district snaked its way from Jacksonville to Orlando and was considered one of the most-gerrymandered congressional districts in the country. Before 2013, similar territory was in the 3rd district.
From 2002 to 2013 the district comprised all of Citrus, Hernando, and Sumter counties and most of Lake, Levy, and Pasco counties and portions of Marion and Polk counties. The district included northern exurbs of Tampa and western exurbs of Orlando within the high-growth Interstate 4 Corridor. This iteration of the 5th district is now largely contained in the 11th district.
The district is currently represented by Democrat Al Lawson.
