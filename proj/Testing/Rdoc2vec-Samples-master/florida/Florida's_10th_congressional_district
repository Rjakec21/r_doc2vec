Florida's 10th congressional district is an electoral district for the U.S. Congress and was reassigned in 2012, effective January 2013, from the Gulf coast to inland central Florida. The district includes parts of western Orange County, most of Lake County, as well as a northern section of Polk County. It is situated in Central Florida, along the I-4 corridor. Cities and towns that are encompassed by the 10th district include parts of Orlando, Ocoee, Winter Garden, Windermere, Clermont, Leesburg, and Auburndale. The district contains popular Orlando attractions like Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort, and SeaWorld Orlando.
It is currently represented by Democrat Val Demings. Due to redistricting after the 2010 census, this district was re-numbered, and slightly reconfigured from the former 8th District. It is considered a swing district, with a slight Republican-leaning advantage.
The former 10th district, during 2003–2012, covered areas further west and encompassed much of Pinellas County, on the Gulf coast of central Florida.
