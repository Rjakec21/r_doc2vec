Florida's 7th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Florida. The district is centered in the north central portion of the state and includes much of downtown Orlando.
The district from 2003 to 2013 consisted of the suburban area between Orlando and Daytona Beach and included St. Augustine, the first post-Columbian settlement in the United States. The district included all of Flagler and St. Johns counties, a very small portion of eastern Putnam County, parts of Volusia County including the central area of (DeLand, Deltona) and the northeastern coastal areas of (Ormond Beach and Daytona Beach), much of western Seminole County, and a small, predominantly suburban portion of Orange County.
Following court-ordered redistricting in 2015, the district now includes all of Seminole County and portions of northern Orange County, including much of downtown Orlando and the cities of Maitland and Winter Park. The district is also home to the University of Central Florida - the nation's second largest university as of 2016.
The district is currently represented by Democrat Stephanie Murphy.
