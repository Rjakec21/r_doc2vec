Florida's 15th congressional district is an electoral district for the U.S. Congress and was reassigned in 2012, effective January 2013, to the northern parts of Hillsborough County, Florida and Polk County. The district includes many of the eastern suburbs of Tampa including Brandon, Plant City, Lakeland and Bartow.
From 2003–2012, the prior 15th district contained most of Brevard County south of the city of Cocoa (including the Kennedy Space Center), all of Indian River County, most of Osceola County, and a very small portion of Polk County. The district took in the cities of Kissimmee, Melbourne and Vero Beach, and Patrick Air Force Base.
The district is currently represented by Republican Dennis A. Ross.
