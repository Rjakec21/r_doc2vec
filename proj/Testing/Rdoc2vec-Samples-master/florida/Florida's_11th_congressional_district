Florida's 11th congressional district is an electoral district for the U.S. Congress and was reassigned in 2012, effective January 2013, from the Tampa area north to 4 other Florida counties: Sumter County, Citrus County, Hernando, and central Marion County, as well as the far northwestern corner of Lake County. The district stretches from Ocala southwest to Spring Hill.
From 1993 to 2013, the former 11th district had encompassed most of the city of Tampa and its suburbs and the shoreline of southeastern Hillsborough County. It also included two areas in other counties: urban neighborhoods of south St. Petersburg in Pinellas County and neighborhoods in and around Bradenton in Manatee County.
The district is currently represented by Republican Daniel Webster.
